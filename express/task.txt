REST API - JSON Format

GET/users - List all users --- return html format

GET/api/users - List all users ---- return json format

GET/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1

(Note:- Here geting id should be dynamic not 
everytime including it in the route in code
GET/users/:id - now by adding ":" id becomes a variable and dynamic)




GET/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2

POST/users - Create a new user

PATCH/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
